**HiClaw is an open-source collaborative multi-agent runtime platform. It enables multiple Agents to collaborate in a controlled and auditable room, with full human visibility and intervention capabilities throughout the process..**

Built on a **Manager-Workers architecture**, HiClaw features a Manager that centrally orchestrates multiple Workers, focusing on collaboration scenarios between humans and Agents, as well as among Agents within enterprise environments.

HiClaw does not compete with other xxClaw projects. Instead of implementing Agent logic itself, it orchestrates and manages multiple Agent containers (including the Manager and numerous Workers).

## Key Features

- 🧬 **Manager-Workers Architecture**: Eliminates the need for human oversight of individual Worker Claws by enabling Agents to manage other Agents.

- 🦞 **Customizable Agents**: Each Agent supports flexible configurations including OpenClaw, Copaw, NanoClaw, ZeroClaw, and enterprise-built Agents—scaling from individual "shrimp farming" to full-scale "shrimp farm" operations.HiClaw Provides Worker and Team template marketplaces.

- 📦 **MinIO Shared File System**: Introduces a shared file system for inter-Agent information exchange, significantly reducing token consumption in multi-Agent collaboration scenarios.

- 🔐 **Higress AI Gateway**: Centralizes traffic management and mitigates credential-related risks, alleviating user concerns about security vulnerabilities in the native Lobster framework.

- ☎️ **Element IM Client + Tuwunel IM Server (both Matrix protocol-based)**: Eliminating DingTalk/Lark integration overhead and enterprise approval workflows. Enables rapid user onboarding to experience the "delight" of model services within an IM environment, while maintaining compatibility with native OpenClaw IM integration.

## News

- **2026-04-03**: HiClaw 1.0.9 — introduces Kubernetes-style declarative resource management, allowing Worker, Team, and Human resources to be defined via YAML; launches a Worker Template Marketplace for creating Workers based on templates; supports Manager CoPaw runtime; and adds Nacos Skills Registry, among other features.
- **2026-03-14**: HiClaw 1.0.6 — enterprise-grade MCP Server management, zero credential exposure. [Blog](blog/hiclaw-1.0.6-release.md)
- **2026-03-10**: HiClaw 1.0.4 — CoPaw Worker support, 80% less memory. [Blog](blog/hiclaw-1.0.4-release.md)
- **2026-03-04**: HiClaw open sourced. [Announcement](blog/hiclaw-announcement.md)

## Why HiClaw

- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Worker Agents operate with consumer tokens only. Real credentials (API keys, GitHub PATs) stay in the gateway — Workers can't see them, and neither can attackers.

- **Fully Private**: Matrix is a decentralized, open protocol. Host it yourself, federate with others if you want. No vendor lock-in, no data harvesting.

- **Human-in-the-Loop by Default**: Every Matrix room includes you, the Manager, and the relevant Workers. Watch everything. Jump in anytime. No black boxes.

- **Zero Configuration IM**: Built-in Matrix server means no bot applications, no API approvals, no waiting. Just open Element Web and start chatting.

- **One Command Setup**: `curl | bash` and you're done — AI gateway, Matrix server, file storage, web client, and Manager Agent.

- **Skills Ecosystem**: Workers pull from [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) (80,000+ community skills) on demand. Safe because Workers can't access real credentials.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**: Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS) or Docker Engine (Linux).

**Resources**: 2 CPU cores + 4 GB RAM minimum. For multiple Workers, 4 cores + 8 GB recommended.

### Install

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
bash <(curl -sSL https://higress.ai/hiclaw/install.sh)
```

**Windows (PowerShell 7+ recommended):**
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; $wc=New-Object Net.WebClient; $wc.Encoding=[Text.Encoding]::UTF8; iex $wc.DownloadString('https://higress.ai/hiclaw/install.ps1')
```

The installer walks you through:
1. Choose your LLM provider (OpenAI-compatible APIs supported)
2. Enter your API key
3. Select network mode (local-only or external access)
4. Wait for setup to complete

### Access

Open http://127.0.0.1:18088 in your browser and log in to Element Web. The Manager will greet you and explain how to create your first Worker.

**Mobile**: Use any Matrix client (Element, FluffyChat) and connect to your server address.

**That's it.** No bot applications. No external services. Your AI team runs entirely on your machine.

## Upgrade

```bash
# Upgrade to latest (preserves all data)
bash <(curl -sSL https://higress.ai/hiclaw/install.sh)

# Upgrade to specific version
HICLAW_VERSION=v1.0.5 bash <(curl -sSL https://higress.ai/hiclaw/install.sh)
```

## How It Works

### Manager as Your AI Chief of Staff

```
You: Create a Worker named alice for frontend development

Manager: Done. Worker alice is ready.
         Room: Worker: Alice
         Tell alice what to build.

You: @alice implement a login page with React

Alice: On it... [a few minutes later]
       Done. PR submitted: https://github.com/xxx/pull/1
```

</p>

  <sub>① Manager creates a Worker and assigns tasks</sub>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <sub>② You can also direct Workers directly in the room</sub>
</p>

### Security Model

```
Worker (consumer token only)
    → Higress AI Gateway (holds real API keys, GitHub PAT)
        → LLM API / GitHub API / MCP Servers
```

Workers see only their consumer token. The gateway handles all real credentials. The Manager knows what Workers are doing but never touches the actual keys.

### Human in the Loop

Every Matrix Room includes you, the Manager, and relevant Workers:

```
You: @bob wait, change the password rule to minimum 8 chars
Bob: Got it, updated.
Alice: Frontend validation updated too.
```

No hidden agent-to-agent calls. Everything is visible and intervenable.

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Higress AI Gateway | LLM proxy, MCP Server hosting, credential management |
| Tuwunel (Matrix) | Self-hosted IM server for all Agent + Human communication |
| Element Web | Browser client, zero setup |
| MinIO | Centralized file storage, Workers are stateless |
| OpenClaw | Agent runtime with Matrix plugin and skills |

## HiClaw vs OpenClaw Native

| | OpenClaw Native | HiClaw |
|---|---|---|
| Deployment | Single process | Distributed containers |
| Agent creation | Manual config + restart | Conversational |
| Credentials | Each agent holds real keys | Workers only hold consumer tokens |
| Human visibility | Optional | Built-in (Matrix Rooms) |
| Mobile access | Depends on channel setup | Any Matrix client, zero config |
| Monitoring | None | Manager heartbeat, visible in Room |

## Roadmap

### ✅ Released

- ~~**CoPaw** — Lightweight agent runtime~~ [Released in 1.0.4](blog/hiclaw-1.0.4-release.md): ~150MB memory usage (vs ~500MB for OpenClaw), plus local host mode for browser automation.
- ~~**Universal MCP Service Support** — MCP server integration~~ [Released in 1.0.6](blog/hiclaw-1.0.6-release.md): Any MCP server can be safely exposed to Workers through the gateway. Workers access tools using only Higress-issued tokens; real credentials never leave the gateway.

### In Progress

#### Lightweight Worker Runtimes

- **ZeroClaw** — Rust-based ultra-lightweight runtime, 3.4MB binary, <10ms cold start.
- **NanoClaw** — Minimal OpenClaw alternative, <4000 LOC, container-based isolation.

Goal: Reduce per-Worker memory from ~500MB to <100MB.

### Planned

#### Team Management Center

A built-in dashboard for observing and controlling your Agent Teams — real-time observation, active interruption, task timeline, resource monitoring.

```

See [docs/zh-cn/faq.md](docs/zh-cn/faq.md) for common issues.

### Reporting Bugs

Export your Matrix message logs and let an AI tool analyze them against the codebase before filing an issue — this helps us fix bugs much faster.

```bash
# Export debug logs (Matrix messages + agent sessions, PII auto-redacted)
python scripts/export-debug-log.py --range 1h
```

Then open the HiClaw repo in Cursor, Claude Code, or similar AI tool and ask:

> "Read the JSONL files in debug-log/. Analyze the Matrix message logs and agent session logs together. Cross-reference with the HiClaw codebase to identify the root cause of [describe your bug]."

Include the AI's analysis in your [bug report](https://github.com/alibaba/hiclaw/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml).

You can also let the AI tool submit the issue or PR directly. Install [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), run `gh auth login` to authenticate in your browser, then add the [OpenClaw GitHub skill](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/main/skills/github/SKILL.md) to your AI coding tool (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.). After that, just ask it to file the issue or open a PR based on its analysis.
