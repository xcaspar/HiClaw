# ============================================================
#
# Bidirectional sync between Worker workspace and MinIO, with clear ownership split:

# Manager-managed (Worker read-only, Remote->Local pulls):
#   openclaw.json, mcporter-servers.json, skills/, shared/
#
# Worker-managed (Worker read-write, Local->Remote pushes, never pulled):
#   AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, .openclaw/ (sessions), memory/, skills add output, etc.
#
# Local -> Remote: change-triggered sync
#   - Avoids mc mirror --watch TOCTOU bug (crashes when source files deleted during
#     atomic ops e.g. npm install, skills add)
#   - Uses find to detect files modified in last 10s; only runs mc mirror when needed
#   - Excludes Manager-managed files (openclaw.json, mcporter-servers.json) and
#     caches (.agents, .cache, .npm, .local, .mc)
#   - Pushes Worker-managed content including .openclaw sessions (backup to MinIO)
#
# Remote -> Local: periodic pull (every 5m), allowlist only
#   - Pulls only Manager-managed paths; never overwrites Worker-generated content
#   - Prevents .openclaw session conflict: sessions are backed up up but never
#     pulled back (would overwrite real-time session state)
#   - On-demand pull also available via file-sync skill when Manager notifies
#
