# Worker Model Switch

Switch a Worker's LLM model. The script tests connectivity first, then patches the Worker's `openclaw.json` in MinIO and notifies the Worker to reload via file-sync.

## Usage

```bash
bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/worker-model-switch/scripts/update-worker-model.sh \
  --worker <WORKER_NAME> --model <MODEL_ID> [--context-window <SIZE>]
```

Examples:
```bash
bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/worker-model-switch/scripts/update-worker-model.sh \
  --worker alice --model claude-sonnet-4-6

bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/worker-model-switch/scripts/update-worker-model.sh \
  --worker alice --model my-custom-model --context-window 300000
```

## What the script does

1. Strips any `hiclaw-gateway/` prefix from the model name
2. Resolves `contextWindow` and `maxTokens` for the model (uses `--context-window` override if provided)
3. Tests the model via `POST /v1/chat/completions` on the AI Gateway — exits with error if unreachable
4. Pulls the Worker's `openclaw.json` from MinIO
5. Patches model id, name, contextWindow, maxTokens (preserves all other config)
6. Pushes the updated `openclaw.json` back to MinIO
7. Updates `workers-registry.json` with the new model name
8. Sends a Matrix @mention to the Worker asking it to use `file-sync` to pick up the change

If the Worker container is stopped, the config is still updated in MinIO — it will take effect on next start.

## On failure

If the gateway test fails (non-200), the script prints:

```
ERROR: Model test failed (HTTP <code>): <response>
The model '<name>' is not reachable via the AI Gateway.
Please check the Higress Console to confirm the AI route is configured for this model:
  http://<manager-host>:8001  →  AI Routes → verify provider and model mapping
```

No changes are made to `openclaw.json` in this case.

## Supported models with known context windows

| Model | contextWindow | maxTokens |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| gpt-5.4 | 1,050,000 | 128,000 |
| gpt-5.3-codex / gpt-5-mini / gpt-5-nano | 400,000 | 128,000 |
| claude-opus-4-6 | 1,000,000 | 128,000 |
| claude-sonnet-4-6 | 1,000,000 | 64,000 |
| claude-haiku-4-5 | 200,000 | 64,000 |
| qwen3.5-plus | 200,000 | 64,000 |
| deepseek-chat / deepseek-reasoner / kimi-k2.5 | 256,000 | 128,000 |
| glm-5 / MiniMax-M2.5 | 200,000 | 128,000 |
| *(other)* | 150,000 | 128,000 |

## Switching to an unknown model

When the human admin requests switching a Worker to a model **not listed in the table above**, you MUST:

1. **Ask the admin for the model's context window size** before running the script. Example: "This model is not in the known list. What is its context window size (in tokens)?"
2. Once the admin provides the context window, run the script with `--context-window`:
   ```bash
   bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/worker-model-switch/scripts/update-worker-model.sh \
     --worker <WORKER_NAME> --model <MODEL_ID> --context-window <SIZE>
   ```
3. If the admin does not know the context window, use the default (150,000) by omitting `--context-window`.
